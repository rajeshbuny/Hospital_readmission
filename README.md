# Hospital_readmission
This Machine learning project will predict the readmissions of diabetic patients with in the 30 days of discharge using logistic regression.

• I have done this project in R & Python using logistic regression.

• Performed Explanatory Data Analysis and applied extensive feature engineering, feature selection and on Diabetes patient’s    hospital readmission data.

• Built Logistic classifier in python using Scikit-Learn to predict which patients might be readmitted to the hospital.

• Built Logistic classifier in R using to predict which patients might be readmitted to the hospital.

• The model performance can be increased by additional tunning.
